## 2025-02-28: Product Creation Fix

### Fixed Issues
- Fixed a critical bug where products were not being created when adding URLs
- Resolved the "Product not found for URL ID" error that occurred during price updates
- Corrected the relationship between URL and Product models

### Technical Changes
1. **Models**: Updated the relationship between URL and Product models in `models.py`
   - Added proper bidirectional relationship between URL and Product
   - Removed duplicate relationship definition that was causing conflicts

2. **Tasks**: Enhanced the `update_product_price` function in `tasks.py`
   - Added automatic product creation when a URL has no associated product
   - Improved error handling and logging for better debugging
   - Added verification steps to ensure product_id is properly set

3. **Testing**: Added test scripts to verify functionality
   - `test_extractor.py`: Tests extraction from any product URL
   - `test_update_price.py`: Tests the URL-to-Product relationship and price updates
   - `test_models.py`: Tests the database model relationships

### Usage Recommendations
- Always use product-specific URLs for tracking (not homepage or category URLs)
- For best results, use direct links to product detail pages
- If you encounter "Product not found" errors with existing URLs, try removing and re-adding them

### Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for any relationship issues between URLs and Products
- Consider adding more validation when URLs are added to ensure they point to valid product pages
